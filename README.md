# Synthrise-DAO-Solidity

As many of you already know, I often post things related to the Synthrise project on my github, but now, Synthrise along with its team is becoming a serious organization focused on the robotics field and will have its headquarters in Los Angeles - California. And I'm on the team responsible for building it on web2 and web3.
